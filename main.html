        <p>Your resume describes your qualifications and what makes you unique. </p>
        <p>To stand out among other applicants, you need a resume that markets your strengths and match for the job.
            <p>A great resume:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grabs the attention of employers and recruiters</li>
                <li>Sells your strongest skills and accomplishments</li>
                <li>Shows how youâ€™re a match for a position or project</li>
                <li>And most importantly, gets you a job interview!</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Resumes, usually accompanied by customized cover letters, get sent to employers to determine your eligibility and qualifications for a job.</p>
        <p>Employers use resumes to get a deeper understanding of candidate skills, strengths and experience. Your resume should reflect achievements, awards, education, experience and any other outstanding accomplishments that align with your career path and goals.</p>
        <p>Your resume is your first point of contact with the employer and sets the tone for subsequent steps such as first interview, second interview, pre-screening and on-boarding.</p>
        <p>Most resumes are ordered this way. It's traditional to put your most recent job at the top of the experience section. From there, experience goes in descending order. Ideally, you want to display seven to 10 years of relevant work experience, in addition to other accolades. Chronological resumes usually include work experience and education both sorted by chronological order.</p>
